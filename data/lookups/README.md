# Lookup Tables

This folder lookup tables to translate codes to description values which we will need to display in the visualization. Airport coordinate data was obtained from Open Flights website (http://openflights.org/data.html)

The other lookup tables can be found at the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time)
Since the data files are too large to be uploaded via github, please download the files from the shared google drive folder (link below)

Make sure you download the files to this github folder in your local machine. The gitignore file excludes all csv files so you don't need to worry about them being uploaded twice.
