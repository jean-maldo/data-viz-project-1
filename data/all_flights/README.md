# All Flights

This folder contains all flight data for the year of 2016

Data is available both in monthly files and a single concatenated file.

Since the data files are too large to be uploaded via github, please download the files from the shared google drive folder (link below)

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By4g_AEW_x0ZdXM1dU1CeU5YeUE?usp=sharing

Make sure you download the files to this github folder in your local machine. The gitignore file excludes all csv files so you don't need to worry about them being uploaded twice.
