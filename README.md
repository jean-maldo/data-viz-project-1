# data-viz-project-1

This is the git repository for INFO 5100 - Visual Data Analytics for the Web

The project will look to visualize flight delays and cancellations in the United States. The data that will be visualized is for flights in 2016. The data was obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' website (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time)

Airline fleet data will also be used to gain further insights to whether fleet size contributes to delays and cancellations. Airline fleet data was obtained from Kaggle datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/traceyvanp/airlinefleet)

Other data files included in this project are lookup tables from the Bureau of Transportation statistics' website for details such as airlines, airports and cancellation codes.
